7. Halftime shows weren't always this greatÂ¶
We can see viewers increased before ad costs did. Maybe the networks weren't very data savvy and were slow to react? Makes sense since DataCamp didn't exist back then.

Another hypothesis: maybe halftime shows weren't that good in the earlier years? The modern spectacle of the Super Bowl has a lot to do with the cultural prestige of big halftime acts. I went down a YouTube rabbit hole and it turns out the old ones weren't up to today's standards. Some offenders:

Super Bowl XXVI in 1992: A Frosty The Snowman rap performed by children.
Super Bowl XXIII in 1989: An Elvis impersonator that did magic tricks and didn't even sing one Elvis song.
Super Bowl XXI in 1987: Tap dancing ponies. (Okay, that's pretty awesome actually.)
It turns out Michael Jackson's Super Bowl XXVII performance, one of the most watched events in American TV history, was when the NFL realized the value of Super Bowl airtime and decided they needed to sign big name acts from then on out. The halftime shows before MJ indeed weren't that impressive, which we can see by filtering our halftime_musician data.
