6. Viewership and the ad industry over time
The downward sloping regression line and the 95% confidence interval for that regression suggest that bailing on the game if it is a blowout is common. Though it matches our intuition, we must take it with a grain of salt because the linear relationship in the data is weak due to our small sample size of 52 games.

Regardless of the score though, I bet most people stick it out for the halftime show, which is good news for the TV networks and advertisers. A 30-second spot costs a pretty $5 million now, but has it always been that way? And how have number of viewers and household ratings trended alongside ad cost? We can find out using line plots that share a "Super Bowl" x-axis.

CODE

# Create a figure with 3x1 subplot and activate the top subplot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 1)
plt.plot(x='super_bowl', y='avg_us_viewers', color='#648FFF')
plt.xticks([0,10,20,30,40,50])
plt.yticks([0.25,0.5,0.75,1])
plt.title('Average Number of US Viewers')

# Activate the middle subplot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 2)
plt.plot(x='super_bowl', y='rating_household', color='#DC267F')
plt.xticks([0,10,20,30,40,50])
plt.yticks([20,30,40,50])
plt.title('Household Rating')

# Activate the bottom subplot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 3)
plt.plot(x='super_bowl', y='ad_cost', color='#FFB000')
plt.xticks([0,10,20,30,40,50])
plt.yticks([2000000,4000000])
plt.title('Ad Cost')
plt.xlabel('SUPER BOWL')

# Improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()
