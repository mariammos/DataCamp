8. Who has the most halftime show appearances?
Lots of marching bands. American jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain. Miss Texas 1973 playing a violin. Nothing against those performers, they're just simply not BeyoncÃ©. To be fair, no one is.

Let's see all of the musicians that have done more than one halftime show, including their performance counts.

CODE

# Count halftime show appearances for each musician and sort them from most to least
halftime_appearances = halftime_musicians.groupby('musician').count()['super_bowl'].reset_index()
halftime_appearances = halftime_appearances.sort_values('super_bowl', ascending=False)

# Display musicians with more than one halftime show appearance
halftime_appearances.loc[(halftime_appearances['super_bowl']>1),['musician','super_bowl']]
